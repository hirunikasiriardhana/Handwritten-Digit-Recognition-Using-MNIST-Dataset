# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-MNIST-Dataset
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The inputs are 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9), which are normalized to values between 0 and 1. These images are passed into a neural network consisting of a Flatten layer, a Dense layer with 128 neurons using ReLU activation, and a final Dense layer with 10 neurons using softmax activation. The output is a probability distribution across the 10 digit classes, with the highest probability indicating the predicted digit. We train the model on labeled training data, evaluate its accuracy on test data, and visualize predictions to see how well the model performs.
